## Components

### 1. Web Automation
Located in the `WebAutomation` directory, this component focuses on automated testing of web applications using Playwright. It includes:
- End-to-end testing scenarios
- Cross-browser testing capabilities
- API testing integration
- Test reporting functionality

### 2. Mobile Automation
The `MobileAutomation` directory contains frameworks and tests for mobile application testing:
- Appium-based test suite
- Cross-platform testing (iOS/Android)
- Device compatibility testing
- Mobile-specific test scenarios

### 3. Performance and Load Testing
Found in the `PerformanceAndLoad` directory, this section includes:
- Load testing scripts
- Performance benchmarking tools
- Scalability testing
- Resource utilization monitoring
